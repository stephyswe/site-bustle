      <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em> is a singular achievement. Not because it is
      a good movie — it is, in fact, a bad movie. Aside from Florence Pugh’s
      transcendent performance, the whole thing basically amounts to a pile of
      empty pretensions, snipped from greater films and sewn into a
      suburban-subdivision-shaped quilt. And yet! Nothing has done more for our
      culture in recent memory.
    </p>,
    <p>
      This is because <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em>, through no effort of its
      own, gave rise to a spectacular swirl of Tinseltown drama not seen since
      the coked-up days of the Golden Age. It is hard to explain how majestic
      this soap opera has become, perhaps because, like all good soaps, it was
      best watched in real time. Over a series of months, we went from a rumored
      rift between a director and her lead actor to a tangled web of blood
      feuds. Planned appearances were canceled. Voice memos were released. Shia
      LaBeouf reared his head.

      . Even Gemma Chan, who has made a career out of giving us nothing, was
      ensnared in chaos by proximity alone. (True to form, even as a portal to
      hell threatened to tear apart the red carpet at the Venice Film Festival,
      Chan gave us nothing. An inscrutable icon.) In sum, we all became more
      than a little worried, darling.

      Which brings us back to the movie itself. The fact that the film falls
      apart at the slightest prodding, like a shoddy, midcentury tract home,
      only adds to the grandeur of <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em>’s larger comedy
      of errors. With that in mind, I have attempted to weave both of these
      threads together, so that one might be strengthened by the other, in an
      ultimate accounting of <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em>’s messiness. Here, the
      twists of the film <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em>, measured against the
      chaotic events of the <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em> press tour.{" "}

                <p>
                  In a set piece that added absolutely nothing to the story and
                  developed not one character, Dita Von Teese briefly appears to
                  perform a burlesque show at a glitzy event celebrating the
                  Victory Project — the “utopian” midcentury LARP that
                  everyone’s acting in, whether they know it or not (more on
                  that later). In the moment, Von Teese’s appearance was bizarre
                  and distracting. In light of the film’s big reveal — that the
                  women are all trapped in a metaverse run by their incel
                  husbands, who sought a way to return to ’50s-era gender roles
                  — it is just stupid. Did Chris Pine beam a famed burlesque
                  dancer and eyeliner-wearer into his secret metaverse just for
                  a brief performance? Come on, now. Be reasonable.

                  In scale, this is roughly equivalent to the spectacle that was{" "}
                  <i>Don’t Worry Darling</i>’s red carpet premiere, which forced
                  feuding parties to finally meet face-to-face after months of
                  warfare. I’d wager that the specific arrangement of a cast’s
                  group photo took hours, and a whole team of screaming
                  publicists, to agree upon. (The ultimate lineup: Nick Kroll,
                  Florence Pugh, Chris Pine, Olivia Wilde, Sydney Chandler,
                  Harry Styles, Gemma Chan. Notably, Pugh, Wilde, and Styles

                  the simulation because it allows her to be with virtual
                  versions of her children, who died in the real world. This is

                  interesting, and makes actual sense when you look back on the
                  character’s actions. It also had the effect of testing

                  In the real world, Harry Styles’ character is not a suave,

                  with a yearning to return to the days when women stayed home
                  and cooked dinner. The sight of Styles doing his best ugly

                  At no point in <i>Don’t Worry Darling</i> is it apparent that
                  Gemma Chan’s character Shelley is unhappy. In fact, it’s not
                  really clear if she feels <i>anything</i> except a desire to
                  lord over the other women as the town’s imperious first lady
                  or to protect her husband (Chris Pine) from slander. And then,
                  out of nowhere, she stabs her hubby in the stomach with a
                  kitchen knife.{" "}

                  that her star, Florence Pugh, was being unreasonable… and
                  referred to said star as “Miss Flo.” This nickname is Wilde’s
                  greatest misstep — it’s hard to promote yourself as a feminist
                  director when you’re infantilizing the lead woman in your own
                  film. It is also her greatest artistic achievement. Never has
                  a nickname been more unhinged, more inflammatory, more
                  reminiscent of a Progressive commercial. Uttering the words
                  “Miss Flo” is like getting a long-overdue lobotomy. Finally,
                  my brain is broken, and I know peace.
